# Create a new ​array_2_spec.rb​ file.

# Create an example group using ​RSpec.describe​ with an argument of ​Array​.

# Invoke the ​subject​ method outside of any example.

# Give the subject a name of ​:sally.

# Inside the block, declare a 2-element array with bracket syntax.

# Add an example that tests that the ​subject​ has a length of 2. 

# Invoke the ​pop method to remove an element from the ​subject​ array. 

# In the same example, write another assertion to check that the length of the array is now 1.

# In a second, separate example, write an assertion to confirm that ​sally​ is equal to the original array.

RSpec.describe Array do
    subject(:sally) { [1, 2] }

    it "has a length of 2" do
        expect(subject.length).to eq(2) 
        subject.pop()
        expect(subject.length).to eq(1)  
     end

    it "is equal to the original array" do
        expect(sally).to eq([1, 2])  
    end
